# RSA-Factoring-Challenge

In this project, I try to perform some cryptographic operations by factorizing numbers, especially large numbers, in line with the RSA-Factoring-Challenge. I make use of different algorithms to find the most efficient one for factorizing large numbers.

One challenge I have had to deal with is handling very large numbers in C as most of the standard data types in C are insufficient to hold the kind of numbers we're dealing with.
